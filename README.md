### 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m an operations and data specialist with a deep background in leadership, client success, and business optimization. After years of managing teams and streamlining systems, I leaned into my passion for tech—learning to build smarter workflows and scalable solutions through automation and analytics.

I combine business insight with tools like Python, SQL, FastAPI, and AI platforms to build smarter workflows and optimize decision-making. My work spans everything from automating reports to structuring messy data with LLMs.

🔹 Built 20+ AI-powered projects across automation, analytics, and backend systems  
🔹 Led 50+ person teams and turned around underperforming operations  
🔹 Passionate about building tools that help people work better, not harder
